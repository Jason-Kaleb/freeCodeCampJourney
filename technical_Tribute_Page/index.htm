                    <h1>Compilers</h1>
                        <p>
                            A computer with a compiler toolchain that can develop applications to run on it and compile C++ code are prerequisites for following these tutorials.
                            The C++ language has seen significant evolution over time, and these lessons cover many of the new capabilities that have been added. Therefore, a modern compiler is required to follow the tutorials successfully. It must support the features included by the 2011 standard, even if only in part.
                            The new features are supported to varying degrees by numerous compiler manufacturers. Some compilers that are known to provide the required features are listed at the bottom of this page. There are a few that are free!
                            You can access an outdated version of these courses here if, for some reason, you must use an older compiler.
                        </p>
                    <h2>What is a compiler?</h2>
                        <p>
                            A compiler is a software program that translates source code into executable code.
                            It is used to compile the source code into machine code that can be executed by the computer.
                            The compiler is also known as a compiler.
                        </p>
                    <h3>Console programs</h3>
                        <p>
                            A console program is a program that runs on the computer's command line.
                            It is used to interact with the computer's user interface.

                        Writing programs is the most effective approach to learn a programming language. The first program most beginners develop is usually called "Hello World," and it just prints "Hello World" to the screen of your computer. Despite being quite basic, it has every essential element that C++ programs have

                                1. int: Stores integers (whole numbers) like -2, 0, or 100.
                                2. float: Stores single-precision floating-point numbers (decimals) like 3.14 or -5.25.
                                3. double: Stores double-precision floating-point numbers with higher precision than float.
                                4. char: Stores a single character like 'a', 'Z', or '#'.
                                5. bool: Stores Boolean values representing true (true) or false (false).

                    <h1>What is an <span>Operator</span>?</h1>
                        <p>In C++, operators are symbols that perform specific actions on one or more operands (values or variables)
                        They allow you to:
                            1. Perform calculations: +, -, *, / for arithmetic operations.
                            2. Compare values: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >= for relational comparisons.
                            3. Combine conditions: && (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT) for logical operations.
                            4. Assign values: = for assignment, +=, -=, etc. for shorthand assignments.
                            5. Manipulate data: Increment/decrement (++, --), bitwise operations (&, |, ^), etc.
                            Operators are essential building blocks for writing expressions and controlling the flow of your C++ programs.

                <h1>What is an <span>Input</span> and <span>Output</span>?</h1>
                    <p>
                        C++ provides functionalities for interacting with the user and manipulating data through input and output operations. Here's a glimpse into two commonly used methods:
                        1. Using cin and cout objects:

                        The iostream header file provides predefined objects for standard input (cin) and standard output (cout). These objects allow you to:
                        Input: Use cin to read data entered by the user through the keyboard.
                        Output: Use cout to print messages, variables, or expressions to the console.

                            <span>if-else statements</span> are fundamental control flow structures in C++ that allow you to execute different code blocks based on certain conditions.
                            An <span>if</span> statement is used to test a condition and perform an action if the condition is true.
                            An <span>else</span> statement is used to perform an action if the condition is false.
